    <p>My old school is Sandvika vgs. It is one of the bigger schools in BÃ¦rum. It has around 1000 students. 
       The school has a big glass roof. It is kind of a bad thing because in the summer it gets so warm. 
       The cafeteria is really good. it has its own chef who creates warm fodd every day. and the meals are 
       in generous portions. the school has a lot of diversity which makes it a perfect school for everyone! </p>
