<h3>stud.nr: jukra6762</h3>
<p>I graduated from Sandvika vgs in 2021. It is one of the largest schools in BÃ¦rum.
     It has around 1000 students. The school has 5 floors. The roof is fully glass so in the 
     summer it feels sooo warm. Its like a greenhouse effect. The cafeteria is super good. It has its 
     own chef who cooks warm meals every day. the meals are in big portions.</p>

<p>The last VGS I went to had a super nice lounge area with air hockey and table tennis.
Me and my classmates used this room during the downtime between classes.
There were also a few really talented teachers primarily my homeroom and history teachers</p>

<p>I graduated from Lake Fenton High School in 2014.
The cafeteria food was really good for being as unexpensive as it was.
A full meal costed 35 NOK, it included an entree, 1 or 2 sides and a drink.
<br>An example of the hot meals was baked turkey and gravy as the entree, mashed potatoes and green beans as a side, and your choice of one of their milk or juice options.</p>

<p>In my VGS we had free fruit in the breaks. We had fruit like oranges, apples, pears, kiwi and more.
    That was my favourite part of the three years I went to VGS. We could also bring our phones which
    was very practical.
